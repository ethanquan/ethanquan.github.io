            <p>
                Robotics and related technologies increasingly permeates our lives, from transportation to manufacturing to
                entertainment.
                I believe that embracing and cultivating responsible robotics technology in all aspects of our society will allow
                for a
                safer future and better quality of life.
                <br><br>
                My focus on robotics lies in hardware aspects: structural optimization, manufacturing, and design.
                I am skilled in Computer-Aided Design (Autodesk Inventor and SolidWorks), Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM), Finite
                Element Analysis (FEA), and design for manufacturing.

                    My journey in robotics began in high school when I joined Galileo Robotics, a <i>FIRST</i>Â® (For Inspiration and
                    Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics Competition (FRC) team.
                    FRC is a high-school national robotics competition, and you read more about it

                            <br><br>
                            The main design goals over the previous version of Sentry were to reduce weight and
                            increase simplicity. This was achieved by replacing much square tubing with plates and brackets.
                            Additionally, significant pocketing and optimization via Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was utilized.

                    Founded in 2013, Galileo Robotics is a team of high school students from the Galileo Academy of
                    Science and Technoloy
                    in San Francisco that competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). We seek to inspire and
                    encourage future
                    generations of engineers, scientists, and tech workers from all backgrounds.
                    We have several subteams--from programming to mechanical to 3D modeling--that allows everyone to
                    build their skillset
                    and work effectively as team.
                    <br><br>
                    I joined the team in 2018 with little technical skill or experience. With the help of my amazing
                    mentors and subteam leaders,
                    I was able to quickly progress and improve my skills in parametric 3D modeling (CAD) using Autodesk
                    Inventor and robot design.
                    I am honored to have served as Galileo Robotics' Captain and Lead Designer.
                    <br><br>
                    We were a 2021 Innovation Challenge Semifinalist and 2019 Silicon Valley Regional Quarterfinalist.

                                    Our submission, Data Chain, incorporates features of previous FRC
                                    competitions as well as adding new features, such as a cylindrical game piece,
                                    button
                                    boards,
                                    and a chain climbing element.
                                    I CAD-ed the field and various game elements as well as contributed to the game
                                    mechanics of
                                    this year's virtual Game Design Challenge.

                            Teams submit time trials of their robots performing various tasks of the game, in lieu of
                            an in-person competition. Robot designs may also be submitted for judged awards in a design

                            <a class="inline"><img src="images/frc2020/powercell.png" alt=""><i>Power Cell</i></a>

                            Power Cells are game objects in Infinite Recharge. They are 7" yellow foam balls that can be
                            picked up and shot by the robots. They're scattered around the field at the start of the
                            match and teams can also aqcuire them at their respective alliance Loading Station.
                            <br><br>
                            Power Cells can be scored by shooting them into one of three ports on the Power Port
                            structure
                            (Bottom Port, Outer Port, Inner Port), each with increasing difficulty and higher point
                            values.
                            <br><br>
                            Early on, we decided that we wanted the capability of scoring the Outer and Inner Ports.
                            Additionally, we also wanted to be able to score the Power Cells very quickly since the
                            rules stipulated any robot could only hold a maximum of 5 Power Cells. This would allow us
                            to have
                            faster cycle times and perform better in the matches overall.

                        <h3>Trench</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Trench is a field element upon which sits the Control Panel (the color wheel). Robots
                            can spin the Control Panel a certain number of rotations or spin it to a certain color to
                            score points.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            There are two trench runs on opposite sides of the field under which robots can traverse and
                            bypass the middle area. However, in order to do this, the robot must be no taller than 32".

                            In addition to being able to precisely spin the Control Panel, we also wanted our robot to
                            have
                            the ability to use the Trench Run in order to provide more options to travel the field and
                            circumvent defending robots. This limited the vertical size of the robot to no more than
                            32",
                            but in practical terms the limitation was closer to 31" to have tolerance.

                            The last major component of Infinite Recharge is the Shield Generator, which contains the
                            Generator Switch, and comes
                            into play in the last portion of the match (the endgame).

                            During the endgame, teams must climb onto the Shield Generator (hook onto the Shield
                            Generator and elevate themselves
                            off the ground). More points are scored if more of the teams of the alliance sucessfully
                            climbs.

                            The Generator Switch is mounted on a pivot and can swing up to 14.5 degrees in either
                            direction,
                            potentially making
                            additional climbs by teammates more difficult. Additionally, bonus points are awarded if the
                            Generator Switch is level
                            (within 8 degrees of the horizontal) at the end of the match.

                <h2>The Design</h2>

                <p>
                    The robot would be split into 4 major subsystems: Drivetrian, Intake/Feeder, Shooter, and
                    Elevator/Hook-Spinner.
                    <br><br>
                    Each would help create a cohesive and capable final robot while meeting all of the design
                    requirements we set out. The
                    Intake/Feeder would be able to reliably intake multiple Power Cells at once as well as storing Power
                    Cells; the Shooter
                    could score the Power Cells in the highest Ports quickly and accurately; the Elevator and
                    Hook-Spinner acts as a dual
                    purpose mechanism to both climb the Generator Switch, balance the Generator Switch, and spin the
                    Control Panel.

                    <div class="col-2">
                        <p>
                            Early on, we decided that our Drivetrain would a six-wheel tank drive configuration with a
                            dual-speed gearbox.

                            The field did not require excessive maneuverability and focused more on linear paths
                            spanning the field. Additionally,
                            the field layout also provided ample opportunity for defense and blocking by the other
                            alliance, so torque and the
                            pushing power of the Drivetrain was something else we also prioritized.
                            <br><br>
                            The six 6" traction wheels provided excellent traction and speed as well as the ability to
                            get over the 1" tall bump on
                            the field that borders the Shield Generator structure. The dual-speed shifting gearbox also
                            allowed us to quickly change
                            from high-speed to high-torque if the situation requires it.

                    <div class="col-2">
                        <p>
                            The intake/feeder system is at the core of this design. Several versions were prototyped and 
                            iterated upon; we tested using elastic cords (polycord), flexible paddle pulleys, timing belts, 
                            mecanum wheel vectoring, combinations of those, and many others. 
                            <br><br>
                            The main design goals remained the same throughout: simultaneous 
                            three Power Cell intake from the ground, linearize the Power Cells into the shooter, and reliable intake
                            from the loading station. Additionally, we sought to find the most compact and simple design in order to 
                            accomodate for the height limitation imposed by the trench run and fit other subsystems.

                        <p>
                            The final design consisted of a pneumatic-actuated Intake that extended over the bumpers and was
                            capable of intake three
                            Power Cells simultaneously. This fed into a U-shaped feeder and then a vertical feeder that led
                            the Shooter. This feeder
                            design mainly utilitzed one central belt was much more compact, helped prevent jams, and
                            eliminated unecessary
                            complexity.

                            The Shooter was relatively straight-forward; a 4" Andymark Stealth Wheel powered by two
                            Falcon 500s. The Power Cells
                            exit the shooter at 27 ft/s at 55 degrees, allowing us to score in the highest Ports from a
                            distance of 10 ft.
                            <br><br>
                            It also has two brass flywheels, each weighing ~2lbs, in order to maintain angular momentum
                            between shots, allowing the
                            robot to shoot all 5 Power Cells in quick succession.

                    <p>
                        The Elevator and Hook-Spinner system is intended to have two functions: hook onto and balance on
                        the Generator Switch
                        and spin the Control Panel. Because both of these field elements (the Generator Switch and
                        Control Panel) are above the
                        robot's maximum height, the Hook-Spinner is mounted on a four-stage elevator, powered by
                        constant force springs, in
                        order to reach them.
                        <br><br>
                        The Hook for the Generator Switch is mounted on the same shaft as the compliant wheel that spins
                        the Control Panel. This
                        dual-purpose arrangement also allows for lateral adjustment of the robot while on the Generator
                        Switch Rung, which
                        greatly improves the robot's ability to level and balance the Generator Switch.

                                This season features a space theme in which two alliances of three teams each
                                compete to load and launch a rocket between sandstorms.
                                <br><br>
                                During the first 15 seconds, driver vision is obscured by a sandstorm; the robots
                                operate autonomously. Teams can score cargo (13" rubber balls) and hatch panels (â 19" disc) onto a
                                rocket and cargo ship. At the end of the match, teams return to and climb the 
                                habitat (raised platforms) as the next sandstorm approaches.

                                The Cargo is an orange 13" diameter rubber ball that is one of the game pieces in Destination: Deep Space.
                                They can be picked up by robots, one at a time, and scored in either the rocket or cargo ship.
                                They mainly located in the depots by the habitats and can be fed by human players to the robots through the 
                                loading station.

                                The Hatch Panel is a 19" diameter, 3/16" thick polycarbonate disc that is one of the game pieces in this game.
                                They can also be picked up by the robots, one at a time, from the loading stations along the alliance wall. 
                                They are attached to the rocket and cargo ships by the robots and must be attached before inserting cargo,
                                so that the cargo does not fall out the ports.

                                A rocket is a 10' 4" tall assembly placed on the sides of the field, with each alliance having two rockets. 
                                Each rocket has three levels that collectively reach 7' 10" tall and are topped by a nosecone.

                                Each level has two hatches, one on each bay. It is an opening on the side of the rocket that 
                                must be covered by a hatch panel. If there is no hatch panel covering the hatch, the cargo will fall out of the bay.
                                Each level has a port leading to the two bays. Robots can score cargo into the port, with each accepting two cargo in each bay.

                                Bonus ranking points are awarded for a completed rocket (6 hatch panels and 6 cargo scored on one rocket).

                                It has 8 hatches and 8 bays, 3 on each side and 2 on the front. The scoring mechanics work the same as the rocket.

                           The Level 1 deck, the lowest platform, is a ramp 3" above the ground. The two Level 2 decks are 6" higher than Level 1.

                                In the San Francisco Regional, we were rank 33 with 5 wins to 6 losses. In the Silicon Valley Regional, we were rank 7
                                with 5 wins to 5 losses and 1 draw. At the Silicon Valley Regional, we seeded high enough to make it to the
                                quarterfinals as alliance captain, the first time in our team's history.

                            new techniques, solves previous design issues, and uses new manufacturing techniques (such as square tubing and
                            riveting)

                            This is a design for a dual speed swerve module intended for use in the FIRST Robotics Competition. It is driven by two
                            Falcon 500 motors and is capable of switching between two gear ratios; this provides excellent speed as well as torque.
                            A NEO 550 coupled with a high gear reduction swivels the wheel. Most of the components must be custom machined.

                            This is a design for a dual speed gearbox intended for use in the FIRST Robotics Competition in drivetrain styles like
                            tank and west-coast. It is a dual speed gearbox, capable of shifting between two gear ratios depending on whether you
                            need more speed or more torque. The gearbox is powered by two Falcon 500s. It is designed to be more compact than
                            similar commerical off the shelf gearboxes while still having three stages and a wide array of gear ratio combinations.

                            This is a design for a 38.44x spread shifting gearbox intended for use in an elevator in FRC. The high gear (8.57:1) is
                            meant to extend the elevator quickly, and the low gear (329.59:1) is used to get enough torque to climb. All of the
                            components (except the plates which need to be CNC'ed) can be bought from commercial suppliers (mainly VexRobotics and
                            West Coast Products).

                            This is more of a concept design; although it can be built, it is quite impractical due to its size and weight. It also
                            has a large amount of stages which will reduce efficiency.
